## Please follow the following steps:
1. Create virtual environment for this repository  
```
virtualenv env_EC
```
2. Activate the created environment
```
source env_EC/bin/activate
```
3. git clone the repository to your folder
```
git clone https://github.com/yangbin-xd/emergency-communication.git
```
4. cd to the folder
```
cd emergency-communication
```
5. pip install required modules according to the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
```
6. __Please uninstall the numpy with high version__
```
pip uninstall numpy
```
7. __And degrade the numpy version to 1.19.5__
```
pip install numpy==1.19.5
```

8. Then, you can run benchmark of location-based beamforming
```
python GBM.py
```
9. And benchmark of channel knowledge map
```
python CKM.py
```
10. The proposed reduced pilots-based beamforming
```
python pilot.py
```
11. The proposed radio map-based beamforming 
```
python radio_map.py
```
12. The integration of radio map and reduced pilots
```
python integrate.py
```
