## üõ†Ô∏è Please follow the following steps:
__1. Configure virtual environment for this repository__  
```python
# Create virtual environment for this repository (pip install virtualenv)  
virtualenv env_EC

# Activate the created environment
source env_EC/bin/activate
```

__2. Download the repository to local__
```python
# git clone the repository to your folder
git clone https://github.com/yangbin-xd/emergency-communication.git

# cd to the folder
cd emergency-communication
```

__3. Install the required modules__
```python
# pip install required modules according to the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps

#  Please uninstall the numpy with high version
pip uninstall numpy

# And degrade the numpy version to 1.19.5
pip install numpy==1.19.5
```

__4. Then, you can run files__
```python
# benchmark of location-based beamforming
python GBM.py

# And benchmark of channel knowledge map
python CKM.py

# The proposed reduced pilots-based beamforming
python pilot.py

# The proposed radio map-based beamforming
python radio_map.py

# The integration of radio map and reduced pilots
python integrate.py
```
